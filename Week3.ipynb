    "1. `def greet():`: This line creates (defines) a function named `greet()`. The `def` keyword tells Python you're creating a new function. The name `greet` is what you choose - it should describe what the function does.\n",

    "2. `\"\"\"This function prints a greeting message\"\"\"`: This is a docstring (documentation string). It's a comment that explains what the function does. It's optional but helpful for understanding the purpose of the function.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. `for i in range(5):`: This line starts a **loop** that will repeat the code below it 5 times.\n",
    "   - `for` is a keyword that tells Python you want to repeat something.\n",
    "   - `i` is a variable that counts how many times the loop has run (it starts at 0 and goes up to 4).\n",
    "   - `range(5)` means \"create a sequence of numbers from 0 to 4\" (5 numbers total).\n",
    "   - The `:` (colon) at the end indicates the start of the loop's body.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `print(\"Hello, world!\")`: This line is **indented** (moved to the right), which means it's part of the loop. It will be executed every time the loop repeats.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The output will show:\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   Hello, world!\n",
    "   Hello, world!\n",
    "   Hello, world!\n",
    "   Hello, world!\n",
    "   Hello, world!\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Points:**\n",
    "- A loop allows you to repeat code without writing it multiple times. Instead of writing `print(\"Hello, world!\")` 5 times, the loop does it automatically.\n",
    "- `range(5)` creates numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 (5 total). You can change the number to repeat the code more or fewer times.\n",
    "- **Indentation** (spacing at the beginning of a line) is crucial in Python - it tells Python which code is inside the loop.\n",
    "- The variable `i` isn't used in this example, but it's available if you need to know which iteration you're on.\n",
    "- Loops are powerful for avoiding repetition and making your code cleaner and easier to maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Alternative Example - Using the counter variable:**\n",

    "for i in range(5):\n",

    "Hello, world! (This is iteration 3)\n",

    "- **`name = 'Alice'`**: We store a piece of text (a string) in a variable called `name`. You can change this value to see different outputs. If you leave it as an empty string `''`, the program treats that as \"no name provided\".\n",
    "- **`if name == ''`:** This line checks the first condition: is the `name` exactly an empty string? If yes, the indented block under this `if` runs and the program prints the basic `Hello, world!` message.\n",
    "- **`elif name == 'Alice'`:** `elif` means \"else if\". It is only checked if the previous `if` condition was False. Here we have a special greeting for the name `Alice`. If the `name` is `Alice`, this block runs and the others are skipped.\n",
    "- **`elif len(name) <= 3`:** This checks another condition (the length of the name). `len(name)` gives how many characters are in the string. If the name has 3 or fewer characters, we print a short, friendly message.\n",
    "- **`else`:** This is the fallback branch. If none of the previous conditions matched, the code inside `else` runs. It handles all other names with a general greeting.\n",

    "- **print(\"Hello, world!\")**: prints a greeting to the screen. `print()` displays text or values.\n",

    "- **Numeric addition (`a + b`)**: when both values are numbers, `+` performs arithmetic addition (2 + 3 = 5).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **String concatenation (`s1 + s2`)**: when both values are strings, `+` joins them into one longer string (\"Hello\" + \" there\" -> \"Hello there\").\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Mixing types (string + number)**: Python does not allow adding a string and a number directly; doing so raises a `TypeError`. Use `str()` to convert a number to a string, or use an f-string like `f\"{num} apples\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Numeric multiplication (`3 * 4`)**: multiplies numbers as expected (3 * 4 = 12).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **String repetition (`\"ha\" * 3`)**: when a string is multiplied by an integer, the string is repeated that many times (`\"ha\" * 3` -> `\"hahaha\"`). The multiplier must be an integer; using a float like 2.5 raises `TypeError`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Operator precedence**: multiplication is evaluated before addition, so `2 + 3 * 4` equals `2 + (3*4)` -> 14. Use parentheses to change the order: `(2 + 3) * 4` -> 20.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Try/except blocks**: the examples use `try`/`except` to catch `TypeError` and print a friendly message instead of stopping the whole notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key beginner takeaways:**\n",
    "- Operators behave differently depending on the types of the operands (numbers vs strings).\n",
    "- Always be mindful of types; convert explicitly when needed.\n",

    "\n",
    "Below, we use the previous examples to explain the fundamental syntax of Python. Each concept is broken down step-by-step, with key points highlighted. For best practices, we reference the [PEP 8 – Python Style Guide](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/), which is the official guide for writing clean and readable Python code.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Variables\n",
    "- Variables store information. You create a variable by assigning a value using `=`.\n",
    "- Example: `message = \"Hello, world!\"`\n",
    "- Variable names should be descriptive and use lowercase letters with underscores (e.g., `user_name`).\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Functions\n",
    "- Functions are reusable blocks of code. Define with `def` and call with parentheses.\n",
    "- Example:\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  def greet():\n",
    "      print(\"Hello, world!\")\n",
    "  greet()\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "- Use meaningful function names and include a docstring (triple quotes) to describe what the function does.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Loops\n",
    "- Loops repeat actions. Use `for` for a known number of repetitions, `while` for unknown.\n",
    "- Example:\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  for i in range(5):\n",
    "      print(\"Hello, world!\")\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "- Indentation is critical: all code inside the loop must be indented.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Lists and Dictionaries\n",
    "- Lists store ordered collections. Dictionaries store key-value pairs.\n",
    "- Example List:\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  fruits = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"]\n",
    "  print(fruits[0])  # prints 'apple'\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "- Example Dictionary:\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  person = {\"name\": \"Alice\", \"age\": 30}\n",
    "  print(person[\"name\"])\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Importing Libraries\n",
    "- Use `import` to bring in extra functionality.\n",
    "- Example: `import math`\n",
    "- Standard libraries are included with Python; third-party libraries can be installed as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. Conditional Statements\n",
    "- Use `if`, `elif`, and `else` to make decisions.\n",
    "- Example:\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  if age < 18:\n",
    "      print(\"Minor\")\n",
    "  elif age < 65:\n",
    "      print(\"Adult\")\n",
    "  else:\n",
    "      print(\"Senior\")\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7. Operators\n",
    "- `+` for addition or string concatenation, `*` for multiplication or string repetition.\n",
    "- Example:\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  print(2 + 3)           # 5\n",
    "  print(\"ha\" * 3)       # 'hahaha'\n",
    "  print(\"Hello\" + \" world\")  # 'Hello world'\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "## 8. Classes and Objects\n",
    "- Classes define blueprints for objects. Use `class` to define, and create objects (instances) from them.\n",
    "- Example:\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  class Greeter:\n",
    "      def __init__(self, name):\n",
    "          self.name = name\n",
    "      def say_hello(self):\n",
    "          print(f\"Hello, {self.name}!\")\n",
    "  greet1 = Greeter(\"world\")\n",
    "  greet1.say_hello()\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Python Syntax Rules\n",
    "- **Indentation:** Use 4 spaces per indentation level (never tabs).\n",
    "- **Comments:** Use `#` for single-line comments. Write comments to explain why, not what.\n",
    "- **Naming:** Use lowercase with underscores for variables and functions (`snake_case`). Classes use `CamelCase`.\n",
    "- **Readability:** Write code that is easy to read and understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "## References\n",
    "- [PEP 8 – Style Guide for Python Code](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/)\n",
    "- [The Zen of Python](https://peps.python.org/pep-0020/): \"Simple is better than complex.\"\n",

    "- `GREETINGS` — A small mapping of language codes to greetings. Keep text in Unicode so all characters (e.g., Chinese, Arabic) display correctly.\n",
    "- `locale.getdefaultlocale()` — Tries to pick up the user's environment locale and derive a language code (like `en`, `es`, `zh`).\n",
    "- `print(GREETINGS.get(lang_code, GREETINGS['en']))` — Choose a greeting for the detected language and fall back to English when unknown.\n",
