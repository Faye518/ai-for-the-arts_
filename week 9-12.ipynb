    "## Creative Design: Cultural Heritage AI Guided Tour\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Introduction\n",
    "In museum or cultural heritage-related scenarios, audiences usually learn about the artifacts and historical background through display board text or audio guided tours. Although this method provides clear information, it has limited interactivity. Audiences find it difficult to continue asking questions based on their own interests and it is not easy for them to form a deeper understanding. For the general public without a professional background, cultural heritage can sometimes seem rather distant. With the development of large language models, new possibilities have emerged for the presentation of cultural heritage. This design is based on this background and proposes a creative concept of \"Cultural Heritage AI Guided Tour\", exploring how to use conversational AI to help the public understand cultural content in a more active and flexible way. This notebook focuses on the design concept and human-AI interaction methods, rather than the specific technical implementation. \n",
    "#### Design Overview\n",
    "The core of this design is a conversational cultural heritage tour system based on a large language model. Users can ask questions to the AI in natural language to learn about the background, significance, and different interpretation perspectives of cultural relics, archives, or historical events. This system can be applied in museums, archives, or online cultural platforms, and is targeted at non-professional users such as the general public and students. \n",
    "#### How the Large Language Model Is Used\n",
    "In this design, the large language model primarily functions as a tool for language understanding and generation. It can comprehend users' questions and generate understandable responses based on existing cultural heritage text materials such as exhibition descriptions and archive descriptions. It is important to note that the AI is not regarded as an authoritative source of history, but rather an auxiliary tool for understanding. Its role lies in explaining, organizing, and guiding, rather than providing the only correct answer. Through this approach, users can gradually build an understanding of cultural heritage in the conversation. This interactive method is more open compared to traditional guided tours and is more in line with the knowledge levels of different users. Users do not need to understand all the information at once; instead, they can explore cultural content through continuous questioning. \n",
    "#### Cultural and Social Value\n",
    "This design has multiple potential values at the cultural and social levels. Firstly, it helps to lower the threshold for understanding cultural heritage, enabling the general public with non-professional backgrounds to also participate in cultural discussions. Secondly, through dialogic interaction, cultural heritage is no longer just an object to be watched, but becomes something that can be questioned and reflected upon, allowing users to learn about the small stories that occurred in history. Moreover, this design also provides space for presenting diverse historical perspectives. Through the guidance of different questions, users can access more than one narrative approach, thereby realizing that historical narration itself has selectivity and subjectivity. \n",
    "#### Critical Reflection\n",
    "Although AI guided tours of cultural heritage have potential advantages, they also have obvious limitations and risks. The responses of large language models rely on training data and existing texts, which may lead to the amplification of historical biases. At the same time, users may mistake the content generated by AI for objective facts, thereby ignoring its uncertainty. Moreover, the issue of responsibility attribution for AI in the interpretation of cultural heritage is also worthy of attention. If there are errors or misleading information, who should bear the responsibility remains a question that needs further discussion. Therefore, when designing and using such systems, it is necessary to maintain a critical attitude towards AI. \n",
    "#### Conclusion\n",
    "Overall, this design proposes a concept of cultural heritage tour based on large language models, emphasizing dialogue, participation, and diverse understanding. Through this design, it can be seen that AI is not merely a technical tool in the dissemination of cultural heritage, but rather a medium that may change the way the public participates. At the same time, this design also reminds us that when using AI, we need to continuously pay attention to its social and cultural impacts."
