    "1. `def greet():`: This line creates (defines) a function named `greet()`. The `def` keyword tells Python you're creating a new function. The name `greet` is what you choose - it should describe what the function does.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `\"\"\"This function prints a greeting message\"\"\"`: This is a docstring (documentation string). It's a comment that explains what the function does. It's optional but helpful for understanding the purpose of the function.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. `for i in range(5):`: This line starts a **loop** that will repeat the code below it 5 times.\n",
    "   - `for` is a keyword that tells Python you want to repeat something.\n",
    "   - `i` is a variable that counts how many times the loop has run (it starts at 0 and goes up to 4).\n",
    "   - `range(5)` means \"create a sequence of numbers from 0 to 4\" (5 numbers total).\n",
    "   - The `:` (colon) at the end indicates the start of the loop's body.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `print(\"Hello, world!\")`: This line is **indented** (moved to the right), which means it's part of the loop. It will be executed every time the loop repeats.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The output will show:\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   Hello, world!\n",
    "   Hello, world!\n",
    "   Hello, world!\n",
    "   Hello, world!\n",
    "   Hello, world!\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Points:**\n",
    "- A loop allows you to repeat code without writing it multiple times. Instead of writing `print(\"Hello, world!\")` 5 times, the loop does it automatically.\n",
    "- `range(5)` creates numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 (5 total). You can change the number to repeat the code more or fewer times.\n",
    "- **Indentation** (spacing at the beginning of a line) is crucial in Python - it tells Python which code is inside the loop.\n",
    "- The variable `i` isn't used in this example, but it's available if you need to know which iteration you're on.\n",
    "- Loops are powerful for avoiding repetition and making your code cleaner and easier to maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Alternative Example - Using the counter variable:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for i in range(5):\n",
    "    print(f\"Hello, world! (This is iteration {i + 1})\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "This would print:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Hello, world! (This is iteration 1)\n",
    "Hello, world! (This is iteration 2)\n",
    "Hello, world! (This is iteration 3)\n",
    "Hello, world! (This is iteration 4)\n",
    "Hello, world! (This is iteration 5)\n",
